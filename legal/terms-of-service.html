Description of Services</h2><p><strong>5.1. Platform Overview</strong></p><p>Swell operates a decentralized protocol that allows users to participate in the security and operation of supported blockchain networks through staking. The protocol is designed to support decentralized network functionality and provide operational flexibility to users who wish to contribute to the network’s stability. Swell does not guarantee or offer any financial returns, and the use of the protocol is intended solely for decentralized network participation.</p><p>The Services include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Liquid (Re)Staking for Ethereum and other Supported Digital Assets.</strong></li><li><strong>Minting of sw-Liquidity Tokens representing staked assets.</strong></li><li><strong>Access to decentralized finance protocols and secondary markets for sw-Liquidity Tokens.</strong></li><li><strong>Website and web application usage.</strong></li><li><strong>Swell Governance Voting &amp; Staking.</strong></li><li><strong>Participation in Wavedrops (S2 airdrop)</strong></li><li><strong>Swell Ethereum Layer 2.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>5.2. Non-Custodial Services</strong></p><p>Swell operates on a non-custodial basis. You retain full ownership and control of your digital assets.</p><ul role="list"><li>The Company does not have custody over your Digital Assets, private keys, User Account or Wallet access.</li><li>You are solely responsible for managing and securing your Wallet keys and ensuring the integrity of your transactions on the blockchain.</li></ul><p><strong>5.3. Unstaking</strong></p><p>You may request to withdraw all or any part of your staked Supported Digital Assets.</p><ul role="list"><li>When unstaking, you select the quantity and type of sw-Liquidity Tokens to be burned and redeemed, and the corresponding amount of staked Supported Digital Assets will be released to your Wallet.</li><li>The time taken for unstaking the supported Digital Assets will differ based on the Asset being unstaked and the underlying blockchain. Swell aims to process all unstaking requests promptly, contingent on the limitations of the underlying blockchain, including withdrawal queues.</li><li>The Company may impose unstaking limits or pause unstaking based on frequency or volume of requests, slashing penalties, or at the Company’s sole discretion, for other reasons it deems appropriate</li></ul><p>As the unstaking and withdrawal of your staked Digital Assets ultimately depends on the processing of the transaction by the underlying blockchains, kindly note that there may be delays, errors or failures in the processing of your unstaking and withdrawal requests. The Company is not and will not be responsible or liable for any damage, losses, costs, expenses or other liabilities suffered or incurred by you or any related third party due to any delays, errors or failures in the processing of your unstaking and withdrawal requests.</p><p><strong>5.4 Restaking</strong></p><p>Certain protocols and networks require that a certain amount of staked Digital Assets be locked for a certain period of time while staking, and withdrawal of staked Digital Assets may be delayed. We do not guarantee the security or functionality of any third-party protocol, software or technology intended to be compatible with restaked Digital Assets.</p><p><strong>5.5 Risks</strong></p><p><strong>Users who stake or restake Digital Assets through Swell do so to support the security and operation of the underlying decentralized blockchain network. They may be eligible to earn rewards based on their staking or restaking participation, however, this is subject to the following caveats:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Risks: Staking and Restaking is subject to network risks, such as slashing penalties, validator downtime, and other unpredictable events on the underlying blockchain (e.g., Ethereum or Eigenlaye), malicious actors, hacking, theft, loss and other destruction of some or all of your Digital Assets. Further, as the staking or restaking of Digital Assets involves locking up your Digital Assets and making them unusable and illiquid for a period of time, there is a risk of opportunity cost or loss of opportunities, or a loss of value or diminution in value in your staked or restaked Digital Assets. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services for the staking of your Digital Assets is solely at your own risk, and that by staking your Digital Assets, there is a chance of a loss of opportunities, diminution of value, loss of value, loss, destruction or forfeiture of some or all of your staked or restaked Digital Assets. </strong></li><li><strong>No Liability: Swell is not and will not be responsible or liable for any damage, losses, costs, expenses or other liabilities suffered or incurred by you due to your staking or restaking of your Digital Assets via the Services these risks.</strong></li><li><strong>Delays: You acknowledge and agree that Company shall have no liability to you or any third party with respect to any losses arising from the timing of any deployment of Supported Digital Assets, including without limitation any delay in staking such Supported Digital Assets.</strong></li><li><strong>Staking and Restaking Rewards come from the underlying blockchain protocol or network: While certain blockchain protocols may distribute rewards to validators or stakers, these rewards are determined entirely by the decentralized protocol and are not guaranteed or influenced by Swell. Users participate in staking solely to support the decentralized network, and Swell does not promise or imply any financial returns as a result of staking.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>For avoidance of doubt, Staking Rewards are not guaranteed, and there is a possibility that Users may not receive any Staking Rewards despite staking their Digital Assets via the Services. The Company is not responsible or liable in the event that you do not receive any Staking Rewards from your staked Digital Assets through the use of the Services, and shall have no obligation to you to facilitate any payment of any Staking Rewards.</strong></p><p><strong>5.6 Intangible Rewards</strong></p><p><strong>In your use of the Services, you may be attributed certain reputation indicators, points, or other intangible rewards (“Intangible Rewards”). Intangible Rewards are not, and may never convert to, accrue to, be used as basis to calculate, or become any other tokens or virtual assets or distribution thereof. Intangible Rewards are virtual items with no monetary value. Intangible Rewards do not constitute any currency or property of any type and are not redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any fiat or virtual currency or anything else of value. Intangible Rewards are not transferable between users, and you may not attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any Intangible Rewards, or obtain any manner of credit using any Intangible Rewards. Any attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any Intangible Rewards or tokens redeemable for or representing any Intangible Rewards will be null and void. Any intangible rewards ARE MADE AVAILABLE “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.</strong></p><p>‍</p><h2>6. Non-Security Classification of $SWELL Governance Token</h2><p><strong>6.1.
